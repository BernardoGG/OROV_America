# OROV_America
Complete evolutionary analysis of a collection of full genome sequences of Oropouche Virus (OROV) obtained since 1955 to 2016 from various South American countries. This study is performed separately on the three genomic segments (L segment - RdRP gene, M segment - glycoprotein genes, S segment - nucleocapsid gene), as they display quite different evolutionary histories. Analyses performed include basic phylogenetics, recombination and reassortment analyses, TMRCA estimation, testing for positive selection, inferring N-glycosilation sites and structural mapping of relevant sites to structures/sequences of closely related Peribunyaviruses.
